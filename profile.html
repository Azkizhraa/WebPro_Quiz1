                        I love playing games, sleeping, as well as drawing (since I was in elementary school, but I don't intend to make it as my career), and i also love cats! /·ê† ‚Ä¢‚©ä‚Ä¢„Éû. 
                        I have lots of games on my laptop, mostly rhythm games because I personally find them enjoying and quite challenging. <br>
