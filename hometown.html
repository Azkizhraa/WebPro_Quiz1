                    The history of my hometown (South Tangerang) is in the area of the Batavia Prefecture. The Batavia Prefecture
                    was formed during the Dutch colonial era. It later developed into part of Tangerang Regency. At that time, there were 3 ethnicities
                    dominating in South Tangerang, namely the majority of Betawi, Sundanese, and Chinese.

                    Local wisdom that is still owned by the people of Tangerang starts from bendrung lesung, a rice harvest party rooted 
                    in Sundanese tradition, sintren originating from Java Cirebon, Lenong Tunah still exists as a Betawi cultural heritage
