            <p>When visiting Tangerang City/South Tangerang, most people will probably recommend the laksa menu.</p>
            <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="Description('desc1')">Description</button>
            <p id="desc1" style="display: none;">Laksa is a soupy, noodle-based dish made from rice flour. Unlike Betawi & Malaysian laksa, Tangerang laksa has thicker noodles like spaghetti. 
                Laksa is usually served with a rich, coconutty chicken broth. Potatoes, green beans, chicken pieces or eggs are also added. Laksa in Tangerang usually sells at a price starting from Rp.20K per portion.
